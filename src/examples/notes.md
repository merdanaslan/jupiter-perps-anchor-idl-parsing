# Jupiter Perpetuals Position Fetching Notes

## Overview

This code demonstrates how to fetch position data from Jupiter Perpetuals without relying on a dedicated API. Since Jupiter doesn't provide a direct API for position data, we need to query the Solana blockchain directly, decode the account data, and format it appropriately.

## Approach

### Using PDAs vs. getProgramAccounts

We initially tried using `getProgramAccounts` with filters, but this approach had drawbacks:

1. Many RPC providers limit or disable `getProgramAccounts` due to its resource intensity
2. The query can time out when scanning large programs like Jupiter Perpetuals

Instead, we leveraged the deterministic nature of Position accounts in Jupiter Perpetuals. Each wallet has exactly 9 possible positions (3 assets Ã— 3 configurations), and their addresses are deterministic Program Derived Addresses (PDAs).

### Position Account Structure

According to Jupiter's documentation:
- Position accounts store all data related to a trader's position (open or closed)
- Each trader can have up to 9 positions:
  - Long SOL/wETH/wBTC (using the asset itself as collateral)
  - Short SOL/wETH/wBTC (using USDC as collateral)
  - Short SOL/wETH/wBTC (using USDT as collateral)
- Position account addresses are derived from:
  - The trader's wallet address
  - The JLP pool account
  - The custody account (for the traded asset)
  - The collateral custody account
  - The position side (long/short)

## How It Works

1. **Generate PDAs**: We generate all 9 possible position PDAs for a wallet
2. **Fetch Account Data**: We fetch these specific accounts using `getMultipleAccountsInfo`
3. **Decode**: We decode the binary data using the IDL structure
4. **Format**: We create human-readable representations of the data

## Field Notes

### Price

Position prices are stored in "atomic" USDC units (6 decimal places). For example, a value of 158225872 represents $158.23. The `BNToUSDRepresentation` function converts these values to human-readable format.

### realisedPnlUsd

All closed positions show `realisedPnlUsd: 0` because Jupiter's design resets this value when a position is fully closed:

- Only partially closed positions maintain a non-zero `realisedPnlUsd`
- When a position's `sizeUsd` becomes 0, it's considered fully closed and its `realisedPnlUsd` is reset to 0
- The actual PnL is settled to the user at closing time, but not stored in the position account afterward

## Limitations

This approach has some limitations:

1. **No Historical Data**: We only see the current state of position accounts, not historical positions that were opened and closed under different market conditions
2. **No Transaction History**: We don't see individual trades, just the final position state
3. **No Events Data**: PnL calculations, liquidations, and other events are not captured

## Getting Transaction History

This implementation **does not** fetch transaction history - only current position data. To get complete transaction history, you would need to:

1. Fetch all program transactions using `getSignaturesForAddress` for the Jupiter Perpetuals program
2. Filter for transactions involving the target wallet
3. Parse transaction logs to extract position events
4. Reconstruct the history from these events

This would be significantly more complex and resource-intensive than the current implementation.
